			<h2>5.	Other Nonfunctional Requirements</h2><br>
			<h3>5.1	Performance Requirements</h3><br>
				<p>Performance is one of our major concerns. As days keep going, it’s becoming difficult to get the hold of people’s attention. In order to make our product useful to them, we have to serve them what they want in the minimum time possible. In order to do so, everything should be handled within 1 second. 
				</p><br>
			<h3>5.2	Safety Requirements</h3><br>
				<p>User safety is our main concern of this project. In order to prevent frauds from deceiving thee participants we’ll verify their authenticity. Also we’ll try to make a feedback page where previous participants can post their opinions about the organizing committee. </p><br>   
			<h3>5.3	Security Requirements</h3><br>
				<p>Users will be able to sign up with their Google accounts. This will verify them as legit users. Since user privacy is concerned, user’s confidential information will not be visible to the organizers.
				</p><br>
			<h3>5.4	Software Quality Attributes</h3><br>
				<p>Adaptability: We will try to make it as adaptable as possible so that it can tolerate changes in the environment without any interventions.<br>
					Availability: The event post will only be available from the starting date to the ending date. After the is met, database will automatically remove the event post.<br>
					Maintainability: The software must be maintainable in order to increase its reusability.</p><br>
			 <h3>5.5 Business Rules</h3>
			 <p>Everyone tries to make a good business model. In order to do so, the event page will be free for the participants and the organizers. But if someone wants to make their event visible at the top of the page, they will need to pay for hourly, daily basis.
